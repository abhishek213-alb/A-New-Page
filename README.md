# A-New-Page
## Inspiration
New year comes with new determination to improve ourselves. However, how can we make positive changes to ourselves? You can find the answers through reading books and equip yourself with knowledge to change yourself. NPD (New Product Development) reports that unit sales of self-help books have increased at 11% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in only six years (from 2013) and have increased to 18.6 million in 2019. 

Do you want to improve your current condition? Do you want to change your lives for the better? Education and knowledge are the keys. Thus, reading books not only gives you education as well as knowledge but also changes your minds and yourself for the better. 

That is why we would like to build a website that can help people find ways to improve themselves through reading books and seeking knowledge through books. The website has a library that recommends books for various self-improvement topics. Further, visitors can also add books that they  think are good for others to improve in the library. People can also share the books they like with their friends through sending emails service in our website. In addition, people can donate books to our site so we can share the books with the poor or other underprivileged people who need books for their self-improvements.

## What it does
- Welcome to our site "A New Page". We think that in order for people to have big happy lives or turn a new page in their lives, people need to have knowledge to make changes. And to do that, reading books will help people with knowledge to change their lives. 
- We have a book recommendation library that was built in Google Cloud. Users can search keywords to find the books that are related to the topic that they want to improve themselves. For example, for anxiety, they can read "Hope and Help for Your Nerves: End Anxiety Now". 
- People can add books that they think are useful for others in our suggested book library
- People can share books that they like by clicking the "Share now" button. They can enter the email, the message, and share the books with their friends. 
- We also have a book gallery with recommended books. 
- Further, users can donate books to us by typing the books, clicking the submit button and we will contact them. 
- Finally, we have a chatbot developed in Google Cloud that recommends books to people based on the topic keywords they type in.

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to integrate the backend and frontend and make sure everything works fine. We had errors when adding new items to the backend but we were able to resolve the issues. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to learn about the backend hosting of Firebase and Google Cloud.
- We created a database in Firebase and were able to query and got items from the database. 

## What we learned

## What's next for A New Page
- We would like to add specified roles for people who come to our site. Some users can be super users who have more abilities to edit and add items to the sugegsted book libraries.
